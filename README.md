## Configuration File (.xcconfig)

In a typical setup, `.xcconfig` files are kept private and not included in the repository, especially when they contain sensitive configuration details like API keys, base URLs, or other environment-specific variables. However, for ease of setup and to allow the project to run seamlessly when cloned, the `.xcconfig` file has been included in this repository.
